I like to code, do data science, research and help create, stir and manage interesting things the require cooperation and several people to achieve. I'm learning how to do all these things, and I think I'll always be learning how to do them, so I'm trying to enjoy the practice and the process. :)

**Work**: I work as the Lead Data Scientist of [ZenCity]. Before that I worked as as a data scientist at [Neura], and as a developer at Intel and [Ravello] (now Oracle Cloud).

**Presentations**: I sometime talk about my research interests and community activity. See more on my [presentations](/presentations.html) page.

**Education**: I am finishing my Msc in computer science at The Hebrew University in Jerusalem. My research interests include machine learning, NLP, dynamic network processes, block chain systems and other areas in both data science and game theory. See more at my [research][Research] page.

**Community Projects**: I co-founded and manage [NLPH](https://github.com/NLPH/NLPH), an initiative to bring NLP tools for Hebrew up to industry standards, and [DataHack], a community and yearly hackathon dedicated to data science and machine learning. See more at my [community][Community] page.

**Open source code**: On my spare time I have been creating some small open source tools. See more at my [code][Code] page.
