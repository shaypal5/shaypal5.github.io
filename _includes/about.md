<!-- I like to code, do data science, research and help create, stir and manage interesting things the require cooperation and several people to achieve. I'm learning how to do all these things, and I think I'll always be learning how to do them, so I'm trying to enjoy the practice and the process. :) -->

**Community Projects**:  I have co-founded, with [Inbar Naor](https://www.linkedin.com/in/inbar-naor-6b973a50/){:target="_blank"}, and manage (as CEO and chairman) [DataHack](http://www.datahack.org.il/){:target="_blank"}, a non-profit / community / yearly hackathon dedicated to promoting data science and machine learning in Israel, and also runs projects such as [DataTalks](https://www.meetup.com/DataHack){:target="_blank"}, [DataNights](https://datanights-il.github.io/){:target="_blank"} and [Kaggle-IL](https://www.facebook.com/groups/kaggleil/){:target="_blank"}. I have recently built and ran the first cohort of my [DataNights Program for Data Science Team Leads](https://datanights-il.github.io/programs/dsmgmt/){:target="_blank"}. I have also founded [NLPH](https://www.facebook.com/groups/157877988136954/){:target="_blank"}, a community meant to encourage and enable joint work on open NLP tools for Hebrew. See more at my [community](/community.html) page.

**Work**: I've been working as a strategic data science consultant in my own firm for the past several years, helping startups build and grow their data science operations, while covering all aspects of the trade, from technical and theoretical to the methodological ([contact me by email](mailto:shay.palachy@gmail.com){:target="_blank"} for consulting). I'm also VP Data Science at [LeO, an insurtech startup](https://www.meetleo.com/). Before that I have led data science work at [Neura](https://www.theneura.com/){:target="_blank"} and then at [ZenCity](https://zencity.io/){:target="_blank"}. Earlier, I worked as a developer at Intel and [Ravello](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ravello-systems/about/){:target="_blank"}  (now Oracle Cloud).

**Blog posts & Talks**: I often talk and write about my work, research interests and community activity. See more on my [talks](/talks.html) page and my [blog](/blog.html) page.

**Education**: I've recently completed an MBA at the [Coller School of Management](https://en-coller.tau.ac.il/) at Tel Aviv University, and I will be teaching the Data Visualization course and TA-ing (assisting in teaching) some of the data science courses there throughout the 2022-2023 academic year. I've have also completed my studies for a BSc (in computer science and philosopy) and an  MSc in computer science at [The Hebrew University of Jerusalem](https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/) (though I have never submitted my thesis), where I've also organized the AI seminar. My research interests during that time included machine learning, NLP, dynamic network processes, block chain systems and other areas in both data science and game theory.

**Open source code**: On my spare time I have been creating some small open source tools. See more at my [code](/code.html) page (I also [write about my open source projects](/blog.html), occasionally).
