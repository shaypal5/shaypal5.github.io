<!-- I like to code, do data science, research and help create, stir and manage interesting things the require cooperation and several people to achieve. I'm learning how to do all these things, and I think I'll always be learning how to do them, so I'm trying to enjoy the practice and the process. :) -->

**Community Projects**: I founded and manage [NLPH](https://github.com/NLPH/NLPH), an iniative meant to encourage open NLP tools for Hebrew. I also co-founded and co-manage, with [Inbar Naor](https://www.linkedin.com/in/inbar-naor-6b973a50/), [DataHack], a non-profit / community / yearly hackathon dedicated to promoting data science and machine learning in Israel. See more at my [community][Community] page.

**Work**: I work as a machine learning / data science consultant ([contact me by email](mailto:shay.palachy@gmail.com) for consulting). Before that I worked as the Lead Data Scientist of [ZenCity], as a data scientist at [Neura], and as a developer at Intel and [Ravello]  (now Oracle Cloud).

**Blog & Presentations**: I sometime talk and write about my research interests and community activity. See more on my [presentations](/presentations.html) page and my [blog](/blog.html) page.

**Education**: I am finishing my Msc in computer science at The Hebrew University in Jerusalem. My research interests include machine learning, NLP, dynamic network processes, block chain systems and other areas in both data science and game theory. See more at my [research][Research] page.

**Open source code**: On my spare time I have been creating some small open source tools. See more at my [code][Code] page (I also [write about my open source projects](/blog.html), occasionally).
