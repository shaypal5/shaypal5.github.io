<!-- ## Community & Events -->

**[NLPH](https://github.com/NLPH/NLPH)** - I founded a joint community initiative with [HaSadna](http://www.hasadna.org.il/en/) to bring Natural Language Processing capabilities in Hebrew to a level on par with international industry standards, keeping up with state-of-the-art techniques by providing open source implementations to new algorithms and tools, and making these capabilities publicly available for both public and commercial use.

**[DataHack]** - I co-founded and co-manage, with [Inbar Naor](https://www.linkedin.com/in/inbar-naor-6b973a50/), [DataHack], a non-profit / community / yearly hackathon dedicated to promoting data science and machine learning in Israel. It is the largest hackathon in Israel dedicated to these subjects.
