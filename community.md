It is the largest non-profit and hackathon in Israel dedicated to these subjects, and it runs projects such as [DataTalks](https://www.meetup.com/DataHack){:target="_blank"}, [DataNights](https://datanights-il.github.io/){:target="_blank"} and [Kaggle-IL](https://www.facebook.com/groups/kaggleil/){:target="_blank"}.

**[DataNights Program for Data Science Team Leads](https://datanights-il.github.io/programs/dsmgmt/){:target="_blank"}** - I have recently built and ran the first cohort of my DataNights program for data science team leads. We discussed roadmaps and vision, project structure, working with product, recruiting and managing workers from varied backgrounds, the right project mixture and so much more. I plan to run more cohorts; [follow us on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/datanights){:target="_blank"}.
