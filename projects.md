## Community & Events

**[NLPH](https://github.com/NLPH/NLPH)** - I founded a joint initiative with [HaSadna](http://www.hasadna.org.il/en/) to bring Natural Language Processing capabilities in Hebrew to a level on par with international industry standards, keeping up with state-of-the-art techniques by providing open source implementations to new algorithms and tools, and making these capabilities publicly available for both public and commercial use.

**[DataHack]** - I co-founded and manage [DataHack], a yearly data science and machine learning hackathon (Israel's largest hackathon dedicated to these subjects).

**[DataConf](http://dataconf.org/)** - A yearly, casual data science conference by [DataHack], meant to bring together data science and machine learning experts from the top companies in Israel for a day of knowledge sharing.

**[DataTalks]** - A meetup series by [DataHack], dedicated to deep, technical talks on data science and machine learning, featuring speakers from both academida and industry.
